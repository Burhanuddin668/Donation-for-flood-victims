                <h3>Food for a family</h3>
                <p>Another 400 meals were distributed in the city of Obreonovac, which was worst hit by the  massive flooding. Local FFL coordinator for Serbia, Madhva Muni said, “The police had to take us over the floods waters to reach the blocked parts of the city. We are cooking around 200-300 meals per day and we could do much more with a little more financial help.”</p>
